Summary
-------
scut is a short perl script that acts as a better (if slower) 'cut', and  
extracts arbitrary columns to be selected based on regexes you supply.  It also has
a 'join' function not unlike the *nix
http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-textutils.html#9[join] command.

Being unoptimized perl, it is considerably slower than 'cut' but it can do
things that cut can't dream of, so if you have 100s of GB of input to slice
& dice, it may be worthwhile to spend some time learning the finer points
of cut and awk, but it you just need to chew thru 100s of MB to GBs of text,
scut may be of interest.

In addition to scut, there are 2 other small utilities here.

'cols' is a utility to 'columnize' lots of irregularly spaced data,
developed with and often used with scut.

'stats' is a utility to consume all numeric-like data fed to it via STDIN
and emit some useful descriptive statistics.

 eg, calculate the file size distribution in the current directory:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

   % ls -l | cut -c31-42 |stats --dist=2 --x=20 --y=10
